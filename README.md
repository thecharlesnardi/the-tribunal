# The Tribunal — MMCS Automation System

A showcase page documenting the Multi-Model Consultation System (MMCS) and its automation framework, "The Tribunal."

**Live site:** [Deployed on Netlify]

## What is MMCS?

MMCS treats AI models as complementary cognitive sensors — not multiple pairs of eyes — and synthesizes their diverse perspectives through structured analysis and adversarial verification.

The Tribunal automates this with 20 files, 7 agents, and 9 models.

## Tech

Plain HTML + CSS + JS. No framework, no build step. Dark mode.
